intro: A weird and wonderful visualization of seamlessly-linked primates.
---

<p class="intro h2">The web at it's best is wild, weird and creative. Monkeys by <a href="https://twitter.com/vihartvihart" target="_blank">Vi Hart</a> of <a href="http://elevr.com/" target="_blank">eleVR</a> is a surreal example of that ethos, placing us inside a seamless sequence of colorful primates. The result is whimsical and strange, but also an interesting exploration of the use of space in virtual reality. There are no flat planes here!</p>

<p>The math behind the piece is actually quite involved, as explained in the <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2015-bridges-conference/monkeys">making of breakdown</a>: "This piece consists of three 3D printed sculptures together with an associated virtual reality experience. The three sculptures visualise different 4D symmetry groups. A monkey motif is placed in each cube, octahedron or dodecahedron of the 8-, 24- or 120-cell, giving objects with symmetry groups the 8-element quaternion group, the binary tetrahedral group, and the binary icosahedral group respectively. The designs are radially projected to the 3-sphere then stereographically projected to 3-space. The VR experience animates each of these, showing one generator of each symmetry group. The virtual monkeys are coloured by an algorithm based on the Hopf fibration from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere, which is then embedded in the RGB colour cube."</p>
